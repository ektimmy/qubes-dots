# qubes-dots
A simple collection of configuration files and scriplets to turn QubesOS into HomesOS

## Foreward:
In an attempt to walk the tightrope of limiting dom0's scope while installing multiple packages for ease of use and ricing, I have written everything in mind for the use of a sys-gui vm. This inherent limitation of working through a non-admin vm restricts the use of multiple tools developed by the QubesOS team for seamless qube management. In an attempt to lessen this severance, I will be using a seperate console in tty2 with a set of keybinds to TUI programs to replace this functionality.\
Where the use of a sys-gui shines is the management of all system files for all qubes commonly used through one template. 

## XFCE with I3
I was pretty set in the use of I3; however I dont want to make a riced bar. So I am going to gut xfwm instead of doing that...yep.
